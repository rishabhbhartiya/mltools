            "Analysis of a recent Supreme Court decision clarifying enforcement standards for domestic arbitral awards.",
        content: `
The Supreme Court of India recently examined the scope of judicial
interference in enforcement proceedings under the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act.

The Court reiterated that enforcement courts must refrain from
reassessing factual determinations unless the award is patently illegal
or contrary to public policy.

This judgment strengthens the pro-arbitration stance adopted in recent
years and reinforces finality in commercial dispute resolution.

Practical Implications:

1. Limited scope of challenge at enforcement stage.
2. Reinforcement of party autonomy.
3. Greater predictability for commercial entities.
